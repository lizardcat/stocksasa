# Stocksasa - A Simple AI Market Trend Prediction App

**Stocksasa** is a stock trend prediction system powered by AI. It uses historical market data, technical indicators, and macroeconomic event analysis (like tariffs and interest rate changes) to predict whether a stock or index is likely to go up or down the next day.

Built with:
- Python

- NewsAPI for real-time economic events (optional)

## Features

## API Key Setup (for NewsAPI)

To use live news updates, youâ€™ll need a free API key from [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/).

- Create a file named .env in the root of your project.

- Inside that file, add your own NewsAPI key like this:

```
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_newsapi_key_here` with your personal API key from https://newsapi.org.
This file is ignored by Git and will stay private.

## How to Use

### 1. Train the model:
```bash
python main.py
```

### 2. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 3. Update events from live news:
```bash
python update_events.py
```
